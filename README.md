This study aims to develop a machine learning model to classify news articles as real or fake, utilizing a dataset of 40,000 articles evenly split between genuine and fabricated sources. The project addresses the challenge of misinformation by employing advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. It involves systematic data collection, preprocessing, and analysis, with a focus on feature extraction and model selection. Various algorithms such as SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are evaluated for their effectiveness. The chosen Logistic Regression model achieves an accuracy of 95%. However, challenges such as deployment errors, data availability, evolving misinformation tactics, and model biases are acknowledged. The study emphasizes the importance of continuous monitoring, updating, and user education in combating fake news effectively.
